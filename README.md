  <p>
    The first month of the program focuses on establishing a strong foundation in Generative AI concepts. Students begin by exploring the fundamental principles of machine learning and deep learning as they relate to generative models. This includes an in-depth study of neural network architectures, particularly Transformers and Sequence-to-Sequence Models (SLMs), which form the backbone of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-services-blog/the-ai-study-guide-azure%E2%80%99s-top-free-resources-for-learning-generative-ai-in-2024/4036890">The AI Study Guide: Azureâ€™s top free resources for learning generative AI in 2024</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    The curriculum then delves into the specifics of training and fine-tuning generative models. Students learn about various training techniques, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and transfer learning, with a particular emphasis on the latter two as they are crucial for developing powerful generative models2. The course covers key concepts such as tokenization, attention mechanisms, and the importance of large-scale datasets in training LLMs. <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tip/Top-generative-AI-courses-and-training-resources">Top 10 generative AI courses and training resources</a>

  <p>
    A significant portion of this foundational phase is dedicated to exploring major LLMs in the field. Students analyze the architectures and capabilities of models from leading AI companies, including OpenAI's GPT series, Google's BERT and LaMDA, Anthropic's Claude, Cohere's command models, and Meta's LLaMA3. The course also introduces open-source LLMs, discussing their advantages and limitations compared to proprietary models.<a href="https://leaddev.com/career-development/best-generative-ai-courses-2024">The Best Generative AI courses for 2024</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Practical exercises during this phase include implementing basic text generation using pre-trained models and experimenting with fine-tuning small open-source LLMs on specific tasks using Python. These hands-on activities help solidify theoretical concepts and prepare students for more advanced applications in the later stages of the program4.<a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/introduction-to-generative-ai">TIntroduction to Generative AI Learning</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    The foundational phase also introduces ethical considerations in AI development, emphasizing the importance of responsible AI practices from the outset. Students explore topics such as bias in training data, the potential societal impacts of generative AI, and the need for transparency and accountability in AI systems5.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the end of the first month, students will have gained a comprehensive understanding of the core principles underlying Generative AI, setting the stage for more advanced topics and practical applications in the subsequent phases of the program.
