  <p>
    The first month of the program focuses on establishing a strong foundation in Generative AI concepts. Students begin by exploring the fundamental principles of machine learning and deep learning as they relate to generative models. This includes an in-depth study of neural network architectures, particularly Transformers and Sequence-to-Sequence Models (SLMs), which form the backbone of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-services-blog/the-ai-study-guide-azure%E2%80%99s-top-free-resources-for-learning-generative-ai-in-2024/4036890">The AI Study Guide: Azure’s top free resources for learning generative AI in 2024</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    The curriculum then delves into the specifics of training and fine-tuning generative models. Students learn about various training techniques, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and transfer learning, with a particular emphasis on the latter two as they are crucial for developing powerful generative models2. The course covers key concepts such as tokenization, attention mechanisms, and the importance of large-scale datasets in training LLMs. <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tip/Top-generative-AI-courses-and-training-resources">Top 10 generative AI courses and training resources</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    A significant portion of this foundational phase is dedicated to exploring major LLMs in the field. Students analyze the architectures and capabilities of models from leading AI companies, including OpenAI's GPT series, Google's BERT and LaMDA, Anthropic's Claude, Cohere's command models, and Meta's LLaMA3. The course also introduces open-source LLMs, discussing their advantages and limitations compared to proprietary models. <a href="https://leaddev.com/career-development/best-generative-ai-courses-2024">The Best Generative AI courses for 2024</a>
  </p>
    <b>Local Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling alternative to cloud-based solutions, presenting both advantages and challenges. On the positive side, running LLMs locally provides enhanced privacy and security, as sensitive data remains under the user’s control. This approach also offers reduced latency, allowing for faster response times compared to cloud-based services. Additionally, local LLMs provide greater flexibility and customization options, enabling users to tailor the model to their specific needs. However, there are drawbacks to consider. Setting up and maintaining local LLMs can be complex and time-consuming, often requiring significant technical expertise. The initial hardware costs can be substantial, especially for larger models that demand powerful computing resources. Scalability is also limited compared to cloud solutions, as local setups are constrained by available hardware. Despite these challenges, the combination of privacy, control, and potential long-term cost savings makes local LLMs an attractive option for many users and organizations.</b> <a href="[https://leaddev.com/career-development/best-generative-ai-courses-2024](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvsHpqLkpw0fIT-WbjY-xBRxTftjwiTLB)">The Ollama Course</a>
