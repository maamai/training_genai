  <p>
    The first month of the program focuses on establishing a strong foundation in Generative AI concepts. Students begin by exploring the fundamental principles of machine learning and deep learning as they relate to generative models. This includes an in-depth study of neural network architectures, particularly Transformers and Sequence-to-Sequence Models (SLMs), which form the backbone of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-services-blog/the-ai-study-guide-azure%E2%80%99s-top-free-resources-for-learning-generative-ai-in-2024/4036890">The AI Study Guide: Azure’s top free resources for learning generative AI in 2024</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    The curriculum then delves into the specifics of training and fine-tuning generative models. Students learn about various training techniques, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and transfer learning, with a particular emphasis on the latter two as they are crucial for developing powerful generative models2. The course covers key concepts such as tokenization, attention mechanisms, and the importance of large-scale datasets in training LLMs. <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tip/Top-generative-AI-courses-and-training-resources">Top 10 generative AI courses and training resources</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    A significant portion of this foundational phase is dedicated to exploring major LLMs in the field. Students analyze the architectures and capabilities of models from leading AI companies, including OpenAI's GPT series, Google's BERT and LaMDA, Anthropic's Claude, Cohere's command models, and Meta's LLaMA3. The course also introduces open-source LLMs, discussing their advantages and limitations compared to proprietary models. <a href="https://leaddev.com/career-development/best-generative-ai-courses-2024">The Best Generative AI courses for 2024</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Practical exercises during this phase include implementing basic text generation using pre-trained models and experimenting with fine-tuning small open-source LLMs on specific tasks using Python. These hands-on activities help solidify theoretical concepts and prepare students for more advanced applications in the later stages of the program. <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/introduction-to-generative-ai">Introduction to Generative AI Learning</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    The foundational phase also introduces ethical considerations in AI development, emphasizing the importance of responsible AI practices from the outset. Students explore topics such as bias in training data, the potential societal impacts of generative AI, and the need for transparency and accountability in AI systems5.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the end of the first month, students will have gained a comprehensive understanding of the core principles underlying Generative AI, setting the stage for more advanced topics and practical applications in the subsequent phases of the program.

  <p>
    Building upon the foundational knowledge, this phase of the program delves into advanced concepts and frameworks crucial for developing sophisticated Generative AI applications. A key focus is on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique that enhances LLM outputs by incorporating relevant external information. Students learn to implement RAG systems, understanding how to effectively combine retrieval mechanisms with generative models to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses. <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-services-blog/the-ai-study-guide-azure%E2%80%99s-top-free-resources-for-learning-generative-ai-in-2024/4036890">The AI Study Guide: Azure’s top free resources for learning generative AI in 2024</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    The curriculum explores vector databases, with a particular emphasis on Milvus, as specified in the program requirements. Students gain hands-on experience in creating and querying vector databases, understanding their role in efficient similarity search and information retrieval for AI applications. This knowledge is essential for implementing scalable RAG systems and other advanced AI architectures. <a href="https://pwskills.com/blog/generative-ai-projects/">Top 27 Generative AI Projects Ideas with Source Codes</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Advanced concepts such as embeddings, knowledge graphs, chunking, routing, and reranking are thoroughly covered. Students learn how embeddings can represent complex data in high-dimensional spaces, enabling sophisticated semantic search and analysis3. They explore the construction and utilization of knowledge graphs to enhance AI systems with structured information. Techniques like chunking for processing large documents, routing for directing queries to appropriate models or data sources, and reranking for improving search results are also examined in depth.
  </p>
  <p>
    The program introduces students to key frameworks in the Generative AI ecosystem. <a href="https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/">Langchain</a>, a popular framework for developing applications with LLMs, is studied in detail1. Students learn to leverage Langchain's components for tasks such as prompt management, memory handling, and agent creation. <a href="https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/">LLamaIndex</a> is explored as a powerful tool for data ingestion and querying, enabling students to build robust RAG systems. The program will look into new agentic frameworks such as <a href="https://docs.phidata.com/introduction">PhiData</a> and <a href="https://ai.pydantic.dev/">Pydantic AI</a>, that simplifies the building of gen ai apps.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://ai.pydantic.dev/">Pydantic AI</a> and <a href="https://docs.phidata.com/introduction">PhiData</a> are introduced as additional frameworks that enhance AI development workflows. Students learn how PydanticAI can be used for data validation and settings management in AI projects, while PhiData is explored for its capabilities in workflow automation and AI application deployment.
  </p>
  <p>
    The curriculum also covers the comparison of agentic frameworks with chains and other methodologies for building Generative AI applications. Students analyze the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, learning when to apply each methodology based on specific use cases and requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Practical exercises in this phase include implementing a RAG system using Milvus and Langchain, creating a knowledge graph-enhanced chatbot, and developing a multi-agent system for complex task solving. These projects allow students to apply advanced concepts and frameworks in realistic scenarios, preparing them for the challenges of professional AI development.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the end of this phase, students will have gained a comprehensive understanding of advanced Generative AI concepts and practical experience with key frameworks, positioning them to tackle complex AI projects and contribute effectively to the field.
